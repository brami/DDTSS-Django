To help translators out there is a fuzzy matching algorithm which, for parts
or a translation which have not yet been translated, attempts to find other
translated parts that resemble the one in the current translation.

The algorithm is fairly simple.

1. Find all descriptions which share a paragraph with the current
description.

This part isn't foolproof, as the part_description_tb table is not complete.
This is to capture the case where a library changed a version number but the
rest of the description stayed the same.

2. Find all descriptions which share a package or source package name with
any of the descriptions found in the first step.

Again, packages from the same source are more likely to have similar
descriptions.

3. For each paragraph of a description found in the second step, find the
best match which is no more than 20% different from the paragraph being
translated.

The results so far seem ok, but it has yet to be used in practice.
